# The ROI of Investing £30/Month in an Email Personal Assistant

## Time is your most expensive asset
If you earn £60 an hour and spend 10 hours a week on email, your inbox costs £600 per week—over £2,400 per month. Even a modest salary of £20 per hour translates to £800 per month spent processing emails. Compare that with a £30/month AI email assistant, and the math quickly shows a positive return on investment.

## Quantifying the savings
Studies show that knowledge workers spend about 28% of their workweek on email. Even cutting that time by 20% yields significant returns:
- Average worker: 2.6 hours/day × 5 days × 20% = 2.6 hours saved per week
- Value at £30/hour: £78 saved per week, or £312 saved per month
- Cost of assistant: £30 per month
- Net gain: £282 per month, or over £3,300 per year

## Intangible benefits
Beyond pure numbers, the gains include reduced stress, fewer mistakes, faster follow‑ups, and more time for customers.

## When does it not make sense?
If you receive fewer than 20 emails per day or already have a dedicated assistant, the return may be smaller. For most busy professionals, the investment quickly pays for itself.
