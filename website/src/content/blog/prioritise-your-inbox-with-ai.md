## The signal vs noise problem
Most inboxes are dominated by noise. Experts estimate that only 10% of work emails are truly business‑critical. Yet many professionals feel compelled to read and respond to everything.

## How AI prioritisation works
An AI email assistant analyses your history to identify senders, topics, and phrases that matter. It flags:
- urgent requests
- client communications
- decision‑making threads
- follow‑ups on delegated tasks

Everything else is routed to a low‑priority list you can review later.

## Battling mobile overwhelm
Many professionals check email first thing in the morning on mobile. Prioritisation is critical. An assistant can deliver a “morning digest” summarising key messages, so you don’t start your day doom‑scrolling.
