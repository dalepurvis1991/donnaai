## What is deep work?
Cal Newport defines “deep work” as professional activities performed in a state of distraction‑free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. Deep work produces more value in less time, yet constant notifications make it rare.

## The attention residue effect
Research on attention residue shows that switching tasks leaves a residue of your attention behind, reducing your capacity for the next task. Frequent email checking creates constant context‑switching.

## How an assistant protects deep work
An email assistant can batch notifications, summarise threads, and queue non‑urgent emails for later. You could schedule two 15‑minute email sessions per day, confident that urgent messages will be flagged.

## The creativity dividend
Digital debt isn’t just annoying; it costs innovation. Leaders concerned about creativity can use an assistant to delegate routine communication, leaving space for strategy and problem solving.
