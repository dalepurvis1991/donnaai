# AI Email Task Manager: Turn Threads Into Clear Actions (Without Missing Anything)

## Email is where work arrives
For most busy people, tasks don’t start in a project tool. They start in an email thread: requests, approvals, delays, follow-ups, and “can you just…” messages.

An AI email task manager focuses on one outcome: turning messy conversation into clear, trackable actions—without forcing you to change how you work.

## What “task extraction” actually means
A good email-first assistant will detect:
- **Requests** (“Can you send…”, “Please review…”)
- **Commitments** (“I’ll do this by…”, “We’ll share…”)
- **Dependencies** (“Waiting on…”, “After you confirm…”)
- **Deadlines** (explicit or implied)

Then it creates a task record that includes:
- task title
- owner (you vs someone else)
- due date (or “unspecified”)
- source link back to the email

## The workflow that saves time
A simple daily pattern:
1. Sync new emails
2. Summarise key threads
3. Extract tasks and open loops
4. Draft the top 3 replies you *should* send today

This keeps your day driven by decisions—not by scroll depth.

## Common failure modes (and how to avoid them)
- **Over-extraction:** everything becomes a task  
  Fix: only extract items that imply action + ownership.
- **No source traceability:** you can’t prove why a task exists  
  Fix: always link the originating email/thread.
- **Wrong “owner”:** the assistant assigns tasks incorrectly  
  Fix: allow quick confirmation: “Is this yours or theirs?”

## What to look for in a V1 product
For V1, prioritise:
- email sync that works reliably
- summaries that are accurate
- task lists you can trust
- drafting that preserves context

Integrations can come later. Trust comes first.

## Try this prompt today
“Review my latest emails and list:
1) tasks I owe,
2) tasks others owe me,
3) threads that need a reply today.”

If your assistant can do that consistently, it will save you hours.
