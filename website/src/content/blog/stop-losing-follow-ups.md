# Stop Losing Follow-Ups: A Simple ‘Open Loops’ List Built From Email

## The real problem is untracked commitments
You don’t forget email. You forget what the email *implies*:
- “I’ll send…”
- “We’ll review…”
- “Can you…?”

## The open-loops list
Maintain three lists:
1. **I owe** (my commitments)
2. **They owe** (waiting on others)
3. **Needs decision** (blocked by a choice)

Each item should have:
- owner
- next step
- due date (if any)
- source thread

## The leverage
An email assistant can extract open loops automatically and keep your lists current.

That is how you prevent quiet failures.
