We're thrilled to introduce **Donna AI**, the next generation of operational automation designed specifically for modern businesses that value both speed and security.

### Key Features

- **Instant Execution**: Turn natural language into SQL queries, API calls, and system updates
- **Privacy-First**: Zero-data retention policy with SOC2 compliance
- **Cross-Platform**: Seamlessly integrates with your existing operational stack

## Who Is Donna For?

Donna is built for:
- **Operations Teams** who need to move fast without breaking things
- **Privacy-Conscious Businesses** that require on-premise deployment options
- **Growing Companies** looking to scale without adding headcount
