# Why we're building Donna: The Email Problem

**Published:** December 20, 2024

Email isn't work. It's where work arrives.

For most professionals, the inbox has become a to-do list that anyone in the world can write on. You spend hours every day triaging, filtering, and replying just to stay afloat.

## The Context Gap

The problem isn't just volume—it's **context**.

When a client emails asking "Is this done?", a simple "Yes" requires you to check three other tools, recall a conversation from last week, and verify a document status.

Generic AI tools can't help because they don't know who "Client X" is, what "this" refers to, or where that document lives.

## Enter Donna

We built Donna to bridge the gap between your inbox and your actual work.

By securely indexing your email history, Donna builds a private knowledge graph of your projects, relationships, and commitments.

This allows Donna to:
- **Understand** that "Project Alpha" is due Friday
- **Draft** replies that actually sound like you
- **Extract** tasks that you promised to do (but forgot to write down)

It's not about replacing you. It's about giving you a head start on every single message.
