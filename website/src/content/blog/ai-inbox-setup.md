## Step 1: Set your scope
Start with:
- one mailbox
- recent history (e.g., last 1,000 emails)
- a clear goal: tasks + drafting

## Step 2: Define safety rules
- drafts only
- confirm actions before sending
- link outputs back to source threads

## Step 3: Choose your daily outputs
Ask for:
- top 5 threads to handle today
- tasks you owe + waiting on
- three drafted replies

## Step 4: Improve with feedback
Correct the assistant when it:
- mis-assigns ownership
- invents a due date
- misses an open loop

That feedback loop is how the assistant becomes dependable.
