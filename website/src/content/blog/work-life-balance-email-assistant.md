## The always‑on trap
Smartphones and push notifications blur the line between work and life. Constant connectivity means work sneaks into evenings, weekends, and vacations.

## Why boundaries matter
Without boundaries, stress and burnout rise. Digital debt reduces creativity and strategic thinking.

## How an assistant enforces boundaries
An AI assistant can:
- batch notifications after hours
- auto‑draft responses for non‑urgent emails and queue them
- summarise overnight messages into a morning digest
- protect vacation periods with polite replies

## Design your own rules
Your assistant should adapt to your preferences. Set rules that work for you, then let the assistant enforce them.
