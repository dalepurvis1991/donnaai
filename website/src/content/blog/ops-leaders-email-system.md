## Ops inboxes are coordination hubs
You’re often CC’d “just in case.” The cost is attention.

Your system needs to separate:
- FYI
- decisions
- actions

## The “owner + next step” rule
If an email requires work, record:
- owner
- next step
- due date
- source

If you can’t name the owner, the task is ambiguous and will stall.

## The best outcome
You can answer:
- “What’s blocked?”
- “What’s overdue?”
- “Who needs a nudge?”

An email-first assistant helps by extracting those fields automatically.
