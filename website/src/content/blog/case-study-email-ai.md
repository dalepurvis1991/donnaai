## The challenge
“GreenLeaf Consulting” (name changed) is a two‑person marketing agency that handles email outreach, project coordination, and client feedback. By mid‑2025, the founders were spending over 15 hours a week on email and often forgot follow‑ups.

## The solution
They adopted our AI email assistant. During onboarding, the assistant synchronised the last 1,000 emails in batches to respect API limits and built context about clients and outstanding tasks.

## What changed
- time saved: email time dropped from 15 hours to 5 hours within three weeks
- improved follow‑through: the assistant extracted tasks and due dates
- happier clients: responses were faster and more consistent

## Why it worked
The assistant summarised long email chains and drafted professional replies, freeing the founders to focus on strategy and creative work.
