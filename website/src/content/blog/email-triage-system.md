## If you’re busy, you don’t need more rules—you need triage
Email triage is deciding:
- what matters today
- what can wait
- what becomes a task

## The 15-minute triage
- **5 mins:** identify urgent threads (money, customers, deadlines)
- **5 mins:** extract tasks and “waiting on”
- **5 mins:** draft the 2–3 most important replies

Stop there. Repeat later.

## Triage questions
For each email:
- Is there a decision required?
- Is there an action required?
- Is it yours or someone else’s?
- What’s the deadline?

## Why this works
It breaks “inbox overwhelm” into:
- prioritisation
- action capture
- execution

Even one triage pass per day changes everything.
