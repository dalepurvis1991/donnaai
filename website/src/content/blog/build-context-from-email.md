## Context is not “memory for fun”
Context is the operational layer that makes drafts and tasks accurate.

From email history, an assistant can learn:
- recurring projects
- frequent collaborators
- your typical response patterns
- common approvals and decision logic

## Why batch syncing matters
Syncing in cycles keeps the system stable:
- predictable workload
- safer processing
- fewer surprises

A practical approach is: sync in batches, store the essentials, and expand over time.

## What to store (V1)
- message metadata (from/to/date/thread)
- the thread summary
- extracted tasks and commitments
- key entities (people, projects, dates)

## What users should control
- which mailbox/labels are included
- how far back to sync
- deletion and retention settings

When context is correct, everything else becomes easier.
