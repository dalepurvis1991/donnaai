## Email pitfalls that cost you time and credibility
Many professionals make simple mistakes that compound into lost hours and missed opportunities. Here are ten common errors—and how an AI assistant can fix them.

1. Overreading everything: the assistant summarises and surfaces just the important parts.
2. Letting tasks slip: it turns requests into tasks with due dates and reminders.
3. Forgetting follow‑ups: it tracks waiting‑on items and prompts you to nudge.
4. Not batching email time: it batches notifications so you check less often.
5. Inefficient replies: it drafts responses based on your style and context.
6. Losing context between emails and meetings: it ingests transcripts and captures action items.
7. Ignoring personal details: it tags key notes and suggests personal touches.
8. Mixing personal and business email: it separates messages by context.
9. Sending emails without context: it references thread history to craft better replies.
10. Neglecting privacy: it keeps information local and under your control.

Learning from mistakes is step one. Step two is building habits and systems that prevent them. For a more balanced life, explore Setting Boundaries: Email Automation for Work‑Life Balance next.
