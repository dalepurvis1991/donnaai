# Integrating an Email Assistant with Your Calendar and To‑Do Lists

## Bringing it all together
Email, calendar, and tasks are three sides of the same productivity triangle. When they are disconnected, things slip through the cracks. An email assistant can bridge these systems even before deeper integrations roll out.

## How integration works (V1)
- sync email: process messages in batches and extract tasks
- add tasks to a list with due dates and categories
- sync with calendar by adding reminders or events
- review each morning with a daily agenda

## Why this matters
Without integration, you’re forced to remember deadlines manually or juggle multiple apps. Tasks begin in email and need a place to live.

## Keep it simple now, expand later
Start with a basic list and calendar reminders, then grow into more advanced workflows. See a real‑world example in Case Study: How a Small Business Saved 10 Hours per Week.
