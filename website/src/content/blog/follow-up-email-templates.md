## Follow-ups work when they’re specific
A follow-up fails when it’s vague. You want:
- what you need
- by when
- what happens if you don’t get it

## Template 1: Polite nudge
Subject: Quick follow-up on [topic]

Hi [Name],  
Quick follow-up on [topic]. Are you able to confirm [specific item] by [date/time]?  
If it’s easier, I can proceed with [default option].

Thanks,  
[Your name]

## Template 2: Two-option follow-up
Hi [Name],  
To close this out, which option should we take?
1) [Option A]  
2) [Option B]  
If I don’t hear back by [date], I’ll proceed with [default].

## Template 3: “Waiting on you” with context
Hi [Name],  
Just bringing this back up—last we agreed:
- [point 1]
- [point 2]

Can you send [missing item] so I can complete [next step]?

## Make it effortless with an assistant
A context-aware assistant can draft these automatically, filling in:
- the agreed points
- the missing item
- the default action
