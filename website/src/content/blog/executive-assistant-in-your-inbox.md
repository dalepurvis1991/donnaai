## The biggest bottleneck is invisible admin
Busy leaders don’t struggle with ideas. They struggle with:
- follow-ups
- coordination
- context switching
- remembering who owes what

That is exactly what email-driven work creates.

## What a true “inbox assistant” does
- identifies the 5 threads that matter today
- drafts responses that move decisions forward
- extracts tasks and assigns ownership
- tracks commitments so nothing is lost

## Why chat UI works
A chat interface removes friction:
“Summarise my open loops.”
“Draft replies to these three threads.”
“What am I waiting on?”

You shouldn’t need ten screens to manage your day.

## V1 focus
Email-first is the right starting point because it produces value immediately—without changing how you work.
