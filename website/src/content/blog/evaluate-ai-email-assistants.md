## Why the choice matters
Not all email assistants are created equal. Some prioritise convenience over privacy; others excel at drafting but not task extraction. Use this guide to compare options and choose the best fit for your business.

## Essential features to look for
- reliable summarisation with structured outputs
- task extraction and tracking with waiting‑on lists
- drafting quality that matches your tone
- integration potential with calendars and transcripts
- privacy and security with local processing and encryption
- pricing that scales fairly

## Questions to ask vendors
- how do you handle data retention and deletion?
- what happens if I change email providers?
- how often do you update models and is retraining data used?
- what is your uptime guarantee and status page?

## Red flags
- assistants that send messages automatically without confirmation
- lack of transparency around data usage
- one‑size‑fits‑all models with no personalisation
