# Why an Email‑Based AI Beats a Traditional Virtual Assistant

## The trade‑off between people and software
Traditional virtual assistants can be invaluable—but they’re not always practical for small businesses or solo entrepreneurs. At £30 a month, an AI email assistant offers advantages that a human VA often can’t match.

## Cost and scalability
Hiring a part‑time assistant costs hundreds or thousands of pounds per month. In contrast, AI solutions provide a consistent service for a fraction of the price. An AI assistant doesn’t call in sick or take holidays, and it scales with your workload.

## Always available and never distracted
Human assistants have limited hours. An AI operates 24/7, processing new emails and maintaining your task list in the background.

## Privacy and local control
Our assistant works locally, keeping your data private and within your control. You decide what to share, and sensitive information stays in your environment.

## No onboarding required
Virtual assistants require training and time to ramp up. An AI email assistant learns from your inbox and past replies automatically.

## Complement, don’t replace
AI isn’t about replacing people; it’s about augmenting you. Many leaders still rely on human assistants for sensitive calls, while using AI for repetitive email triage, task extraction, and drafting.
