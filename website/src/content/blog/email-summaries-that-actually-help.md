## The wrong summary is just shorter noise
A good summary answers:
- What happened?
- What was decided?
- What’s next?
- Who owns it?
- What’s blocked?

## The best summary format
- **Context:** 1–2 lines
- **Decisions:** bullets
- **Action items:** owner + date
- **Open questions:** bullets

## Why this matters
Busy people don’t read; they scan. Summaries must drive action, not rephrase.

## V1 requirement
If your assistant can deliver consistently structured summaries, it becomes a daily tool—not a novelty.
