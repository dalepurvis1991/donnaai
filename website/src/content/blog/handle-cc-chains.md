## CC chains are attention traps
They feel important because they are noisy, not because they require action.

## The CC filter
Ask:
1. Am I the decision maker?
2. Am I the executor?
3. Is my input required now?

If “no” to all three: archive and move on.

## When you *should* engage
- the thread is drifting without ownership
- a deadline is at risk
- the decision is unclear

Then reply with a short structure:
- decision owner
- next step
- deadline

## Make it scalable
An assistant can label CC threads:
- FYI
- Action needed
- Waiting on others
