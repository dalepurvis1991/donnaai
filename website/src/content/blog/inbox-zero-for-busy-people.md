# Inbox Zero for Busy People: A Practical System That Doesn’t Fall Apart

## Inbox Zero is a control system, not a number
Most people fail at Inbox Zero because they treat it like housekeeping. In reality, your inbox is a stream of decisions.

The goal is to:
- decide faster
- capture tasks reliably
- close loops with less typing

## The 4-bucket method (works under pressure)
Every email gets one outcome:
1. **Do (now):** < 2 minutes
2. **Delegate:** send/assign and record the follow-up
3. **Defer:** convert to a task with a date
4. **Delete/Archive:** keep it moving

If you can’t choose a bucket in 15 seconds, you need a summary first.

## Where AI helps (without changing your workflow)
An email-first assistant can:
- summarise long threads into “what matters”
- highlight who owes what
- propose next steps
- draft replies in your tone

That reduces the cognitive load of deciding.

## The most important habit: “open loops”
Busy inboxes aren’t just volume. They’re **unfinished commitments**:
- “Let me get back to you”
- “I’ll send that later”
- “Can you confirm?”

Your system needs a place where these live outside the inbox.

## A daily routine you can actually keep
- **Morning (10 mins):** identify today’s 3 replies and 3 tasks
- **Midday (5 mins):** clear urgent items
- **End of day (10 mins):** capture open loops, draft tomorrow’s key replies

Consistency beats heroics.

## If you want Inbox Zero, build this first
- a reliable task capture method from email
- a follow-up list (“waiting on”)
- a drafting assistant to reduce typing

Inbox Zero happens as a side effect.
