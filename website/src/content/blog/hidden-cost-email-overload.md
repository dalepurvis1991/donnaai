## Why email overload is killing your day (and profit)
If you’re running a business or leading a team, your inbox is probably the biggest thief of time. Professionals receive more than 121 emails every day and send about 40. Even with modern tools, the average worker spends 5–15.5 hours per week on email—up to 28% of the workweek.

When more than 376 billion emails are sent every day, it’s no surprise that almost two thirds of people say they don’t have enough time or energy to do their jobs.

## The cost of lost hours
Email isn’t free. Every minute spent triaging, reading, and replying is a minute not spent growing your business.

Hidden time leaks include:
- only 30% of emails requiring immediate action
- checking email 11–36 times per hour
- constant interruptions that cut focus time

## The toll on decision-making and creativity
Constant context switching erodes productivity. Research shows the average employee spends most of the day communicating, leaving limited time for creation. Digital debt makes innovation harder and leaders worry that lack of focus is stifling creativity.

## Why an email assistant changes everything
An AI email assistant isn’t about automating away your relationships—it’s about reclaiming your time. A well‑designed assistant can:
- summarise threads and extract action items
- draft replies in your tone for approval
- track commitments so nothing gets lost
- batch process inboxes without hitting rate limits

## Why it’s worth paying for help
Time has value. If your effective hourly rate is £60 and you spend ten hours a week on email, that’s £600 of lost productivity. An assistant that costs around £30 per month pays for itself if it saves you even half an hour a week.
