# Email Overload and Delegation: The Follow-Up System Most Teams Forget

## Delegation breaks at follow-up
You delegate a task in email, then the thread disappears. A week later you realise nothing happened.

The missing layer is a “waiting on” list:
- owner
- due date
- last touch
- next follow-up date

## What to extract from email delegation
When you send: “Can you handle this?”
Capture:
- what “this” is (task title)
- who owns it
- what “done” looks like
- when you’ll check in

## The two-touch rule
Every delegated task has two planned touches:
1. delegation message
2. follow-up checkpoint (“Any update?”)

If you schedule both, you stop relying on memory.

## Where an email assistant helps
A good assistant can:
- detect delegation language
- create a waiting-on entry automatically
- remind you when a follow-up is due
- draft the follow-up message

## The team benefit
This isn’t micromanagement. It’s clarity:
- fewer surprises
- fewer last-minute escalations
- less mental load for leaders

Delegation is only complete when follow-up is planned.
