## Back-and-forth is usually missing information
Most ping-pong threads exist because one of these is unclear:
- decision owner
- deadline
- definition of done
- next step

## 7 patterns to reduce it
1. **Put the decision early:** “Decision: we’ll proceed with X.”
2. **Bullet the next steps:** owners + dates.
3. **Ask one question at a time** (or number questions).
4. **Offer two options** instead of open-ended asks.
5. **Confirm assumptions:** “If I’ve understood correctly…”
6. **Close loops explicitly:** “Once you confirm, I’ll…”
7. **Summarise long threads** before replying.

## Templates you can reuse
**Decision + next steps**
- Decision: …
- Next steps:
  - A — owner — date
  - B — owner — date

**Two-option ask**
“Which do you prefer?
1) Option A (…)
2) Option B (…)
If I don’t hear back by [date], I’ll proceed with [default].”

## Where an assistant helps
An email assistant can draft in these patterns automatically, based on thread context.

Less typing. Fewer loops. Faster outcomes.
