## Automate the prep, not the responsibility
The best V1 automation is:
- low risk
- high time savings
- easy to verify

## Automate first
- thread summarisation
- task and open-loop extraction
- reply drafting
- follow-up reminders (“waiting on”)

## Keep manual (for now)
- sending sensitive emails automatically
- committing to prices or legal terms
- deleting or moving messages in bulk

## The winning model for busy people
Chat-first UI + human approval + traceable context.

That’s how you move fast without mistakes.
