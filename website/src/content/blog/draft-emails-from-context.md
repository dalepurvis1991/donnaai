# How to Draft Emails From Context (So You Stop Re-Reading Threads)

## The real time sink: re-reading threads
Most email time is not writing. It’s reconstructing context:
- What did we agree?
- Who asked for what?
- What’s the deadline?

A context-aware assistant should do that reconstruction for you.

## What “context” should include
For a draft to be usable, it needs:
- the last message + key prior points
- names and roles
- decisions made and pending decisions
- your likely stance (based on past tone and outcomes)

## A simple drafting framework
Ask your assistant to draft using:
1. **Acknowledgement** (1 sentence)
2. **Answer / decision** (clear, early)
3. **Next steps** (bullets)
4. **Timing** (what happens when)
5. **Close** (polite, short)

## Example prompt
“Draft a reply that:
- confirms what we agreed,
- asks for the missing detail,
- proposes next steps in bullet points,
- sounds calm and direct.”

## Guardrails that keep drafts safe
- Default to **“draft only”** (you approve before sending)
- Include a **confidence note** when details are inferred
- Quote or reference the specific email that supports the claim

## What to optimise in V1
- accuracy over creativity
- clarity over cleverness
- next steps over long explanations

Busy people don’t want “beautiful.” They want “sendable.”
