## Short emails reduce work for everyone
Long emails create:
- more questions
- more misunderstandings
- more back-and-forth

## The 5-sentence rule
Aim for:
1. Why I’m writing
2. Decision / ask
3. Context (only what’s needed)
4. Next step + deadline
5. Close

## Bullet points are your friend
If you have more than two asks, number them.

## Where AI helps
An assistant can compress your message into a short structure while preserving the important facts from the thread.
