# Building Trust: Privacy and Security in AI Email Assistants

## Why privacy matters
Email contains sensitive information—client data, pricing, legal agreements. It’s one reason many professionals hesitate to use digital assistants. AI doesn’t have to compromise privacy.

## Local processing and encryption
Our assistant runs on your local infrastructure. Emails are processed within your environment; nothing is sent to third‑party servers without your consent. All stored data—summaries, tasks, and drafts—is encrypted at rest.

## Human‑in‑the‑loop safeguards
By default, the assistant drafts replies and proposes actions but always asks for your confirmation. Sensitive actions require explicit approval.

## Transparency and auditability
Every action the assistant takes is logged. You can review which messages were summarised, which tasks were created, and when drafts were generated.

## Choosing wisely
When evaluating, consider where data is processed, whether encryption is used, and how much control you have over sending messages. For a full evaluation checklist, read How to Evaluate Email Assistants for Your Business.
