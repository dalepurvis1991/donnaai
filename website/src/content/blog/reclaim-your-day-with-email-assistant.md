## Decision fatigue is real
Executives are bombarded with decisions. Research shows that employees spend most of their work time communicating, leaving limited time for creation. Constantly switching between conversations drains mental energy and increases the risk of poor decisions.

## Zero in on high‑impact work
An AI email assistant acts as a filter. By summarising threads and highlighting requests that truly require your input, it protects your calendar.

## Reduce digital debt and protect focus time
By batch‑processing your inbox and reducing frequent interruptions, an AI assistant shields blocks of time for deep work. Schedule a daily or twice‑daily “inbox review” session, confident that nothing urgent will be missed.

## Ensure follow‑through
With open‑loop tracking, the assistant keeps a list of delegated items and reminds you when a response is due. Integrating meeting transcripts connects decisions back to your email tasks.

## Maintain work‑life boundaries
An assistant can triage after hours, surfacing only critical emails. You check your inbox on your terms, not everyone else’s.
