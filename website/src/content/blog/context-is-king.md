# Context is King: How Donna understands your work

Why do most AI assistants feel like a novelty toy? Because they have amnesia.

They don't know that "The Smith Project" was renamed to "Project Falcon" last week. They don't know that you owe Sarah a budget report by EOD. They treat every interaction as Day 1.

## Building the Knowledge Graph

Donna is different. When you sync your email, Donna doesn't just "read" messages—it builds a structured map of your world.

1.  **Entity Resolution**: Identifies people, companies, and projects across threads.
2.  **Temporal Awareness**: Understands deadlines, "next week", and "yesterday".
3.  **Sentiment Analysis**: Prioritizes urgent client requests over newsletters.

## Privacy First

We know what you're thinking: "That sounds unsafe."

That's why we built Donna with a **privacy-first architecture**:
- Data stays in your secure instance (or local environment for Enterprise).
- We never train our public models on your private data.
- You control exactly which folders or timeframes are synced.

Context makes the assistant useful. Privacy makes it usable.
