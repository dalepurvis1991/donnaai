## From conversations to commitments
Meetings generate decisions, but those decisions often die in follow‑up emails—or never make it into your task list. Meeting tools can record calls, generate transcripts, and send summaries to your inbox.

## Why paste transcripts into your assistant?
Here’s how meeting transcripts and an email assistant work together:
- record and transcribe a call
- paste the transcript into your assistant
- extract tasks and decisions with owners and due dates
- draft a follow‑up recap email with next steps

## Use cases for busy professionals
- sales: recap client calls and draft proposals
- operations: turn daily huddles into checklists
- research: catalogue insights and action items

For solo business owners, this integration offers project management without extra tools. Learn how this improves client relationships in How an Email Assistant Improves Client Relationships.
