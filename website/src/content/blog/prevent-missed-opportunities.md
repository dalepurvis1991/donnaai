## The cost of forgetting
Have you ever agreed to send a document and realised a week later that you never did? Those slips cost credibility and revenue. With high email volume, manual tracking is nearly impossible.

## How open‑loop tracking works
An email assistant monitors phrases like “I’ll send…,” “Can you…,” and “Let’s do… by Friday.” It records:
- task title
- owner
- due date
- source thread link
- status (open, waiting, done)

## Why this matters for small businesses
Entrepreneurs juggle multiple clients and roles. By offloading follow‑up tracking to an assistant, you free mental space for revenue‑generating work and improve customer experience.

## Integrating with meeting summaries
When combined with meeting transcript integration, the assistant captures commitments made verbally and links them to your email threads.
