## AI in email must be safe by default
You want speed, but not at the cost of:
- wrong commitments
- incorrect facts
- inappropriate tone

## Best practices
1. **Draft-only mode** by default
2. **Always cite the thread context** (internally) for decisions
3. **Use a consistent structure:** decision → next steps → timing
4. **Flag uncertainty:** “I may be missing X—confirm?”
5. **Keep it short** (busy recipients scan)
6. **Preserve names and dates** from the thread
7. **Confirm before sending** on sensitive topics

## The strongest workflow
- assistant drafts
- you approve
- assistant optionally suggests a follow-up task

That’s how you get leverage without losing control.
