## The hidden cost of meetings: lost decisions
Most meetings fail after the call ends. Decisions and tasks evaporate.

Transcripts change that. If you capture the text, you can extract:
- decisions
- action items
- owners
- due dates
- follow-up emails

## A simple transcript workflow
1. Paste transcript into your assistant
2. Ask for:
   - top decisions
   - action items (owner + due)
   - risks/unknowns
3. Draft:
   - internal summary
   - external follow-up email

## The prompt that works
“From this transcript:
- list all action items with owners and dates,
- list decisions made,
- draft a follow-up email to attendees summarising decisions and next steps.”

## Where Fathom fits
If you use a meeting tool that provides transcripts, you can:
- export transcripts
- paste them in
- (later) automate ingestion when integration is ready

Even manual paste-in is high leverage.
