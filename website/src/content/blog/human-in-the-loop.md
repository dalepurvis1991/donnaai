# The Power of Human-in-the-Loop Automation

In the world of AI, speed is cheap. Accuracy is expensive.

Many "autonomous" agents promise to send emails for you, book meetings, and run your life on autopilot. But when an AI hallucinates a price quote or sends a generic reply to a VIP client, the damage is real.

## Draft, Don't Send

At Donna, we believe in **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** automation.

Donna's job isn't to replace you—it's to tee you up for success.
- **Donna:** reads the thread, drafts a reply, queues the task.
- **You:** review the draft, tweak the tone, hit send.

This approach gives you **90% of the speed benefit with 0% of the risk**.

## The Feedback Loop

Every time you edit a draft, Donna learns.
- "Too formal? Okay, I'll be more casual next time."
- "Wrong project code? Got it, I'll update my map."

This creates a virtuous cycle where Donna gets smarter the more you use it, without ever risking your professional reputation.
