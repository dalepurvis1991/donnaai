# Why Freelancers and Solo Businesses Need an Email Assistant

## One person, many hats
Freelancers and one‑person businesses can’t offload work to colleagues. They handle sales, fulfilment, accounting, and customer service alone. Clients expect quick responses, but without help it’s easy to let opportunities slip.

## Your inbox as a sales funnel
Many freelancers land work through email. Missing a prospective client’s message because it got buried under spam could cost hundreds or thousands of pounds. An assistant that flags potential leads ensures you never miss a chance.

## Automating proposals and follow‑ups
Freelancers spend countless hours writing proposals and chasing payments. An assistant can draft quotes or proposals based on templates and past negotiations, and remind clients of outstanding invoices.

## Project management without the overhead
An email assistant extracts tasks directly from conversations and organises them into a simple list you can review each morning. Coupled with meeting transcripts, it keeps projects on track without complex software.

## Affordable and scalable support
Hiring a virtual assistant may be out of reach, but an AI assistant at around £30/month is accessible. It scales with your workload—whether you have three clients or thirty.
