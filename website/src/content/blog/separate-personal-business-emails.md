# Separate Work from Life: How an Assistant Differentiates Personal and Business Emails

## Two inboxes, one brain
Many professionals have multiple addresses or aliases, but messages still end up in the same mail app. It’s easy to misfile a personal order confirmation with an important contract, or to reply to a friend with corporate formality.

## Why separation matters
Mixing personal and business messages leads to missed deadlines and social faux pas. Separating by context helps you respond appropriately and maintain boundaries.

## How an assistant helps
A smart assistant learns the difference between personal and professional correspondence. It uses sender information, keywords, and your past behaviour to classify messages. Once categorised, it can:
- apply different response templates (casual vs formal)
- prioritise business messages during work hours
- stop personal newsletters from cluttering your workday

## Integrate with work‑life boundaries
Combining separation with work‑life balance automation keeps your personal life from bleeding into your business and vice versa.
