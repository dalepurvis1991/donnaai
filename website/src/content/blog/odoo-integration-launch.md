Today, we're excited to announce native **Odoo integration** for Donna AI. Connect your Odoo instance and let Donna handle your CRM and ERP workflows through natural conversation.

## What You Can Do

With Donna's Odoo integration, you can:

- **Create leads** from email summaries automatically
- **Log meeting notes** via voice dictation
- **Update deal stages** with a single command
- **Query inventory** and get instant stock updates
- **Schedule activities** across your sales pipeline

## How It Works

Donna connects to your Odoo instance via secure API. Simply provide your credentials, and Donna will:

1. Authenticate securely using OAuth 2.0
2. Map your Odoo modules and custom fields
3. Start executing tasks based on your natural language requests

## Security First

All Odoo connections are:
- **Encrypted end-to-end**
- **SOC2 compliant**
- **Zero-data retention** (your data never trains our models)
