# Customising Your Email Assistant: Personalised Workflows and Preferences

## One size doesn’t fit all
Every professional has different needs. A sales executive, a solo consultant, and a charity director all use email differently. Customisation ensures your assistant serves you rather than forcing you into a rigid workflow.

## Define your tone and style
Feed the assistant examples of your writing. It will learn how you greet clients, sign off, and structure information. Always review and adjust drafts until they feel right.

## Tailor your prompts
Create reusable prompts for common tasks:
- “Summarise my last 24 hours of email and highlight urgent issues.”
- “Draft a proposal for a new client using our standard template.”
- “List all tasks due this week and who owns them.”

## Set up rules and preferences
- notification schedules
- priority definitions
- privacy settings for mailboxes and labels

## Evolve over time
As your business grows or your role changes, revisit your preferences. Add new templates, adjust priorities, and integrate new tools.
