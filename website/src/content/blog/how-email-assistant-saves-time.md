## Stop juggling, start delegating
If your inbox feels like a second job, you’re not alone. Knowledge workers often spend 10–12 hours per week on email, checking their inbox 20+ times a day. Here are five concrete ways an AI email assistant takes that burden off your shoulders.

## 1. Summarise long threads instantly
Instead of rereading the same chain five times, an assistant condenses a thread into the key points—what happened, what decisions were made, and what’s next.

## 2. Extract and track tasks
By recognising phrases like “Can you…?” or “Let’s do X by Monday,” the assistant creates a task with owner and due date so commitments don’t slip.

## 3. Draft replies in your voice
A good assistant references past emails to match your tone and keeps you in control by asking you to approve before sending.

## 4. Capture follow-ups and waiting-on lists
Delegation fails without follow‑up. The assistant keeps a “waiting on” list of tasks others owe you and prompts you when it’s time to nudge.

## 5. Maintain context across emails and meetings
Some assistants can ingest meeting transcripts. When a transcript is pasted into chat, the assistant extracts decisions and action items, then links them back to related emails.

## Why small wins add up
Even if each automation saves two minutes, multiply that by 120 daily emails and the minutes turn into hours.
