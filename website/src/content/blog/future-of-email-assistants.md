## A response to digital debt
The pace of work is accelerating. People struggle to keep up with the inflow of data and messages, and digital debt is costing innovation. As long as email remains the default medium for business communication, tools that reduce email friction will thrive.

## Why adoption is rising
Several forces are converging:
- volume: billions of emails are sent daily
- AI accessibility: summarisation and drafting are now affordable
- privacy demands: local processing is becoming standard
- return on investment: even small efficiency gains produce big returns

## How this impacts small businesses
AI email assistants level the playing field—giving micro‑enterprises access to capabilities once reserved for large teams. Clients will come to expect faster responses and thorough follow‑ups.

## Preparing for the future
Start integrating AI tools now, focusing on email first. Build trust by using local, privacy‑first solutions and giving yourself time to adapt.
