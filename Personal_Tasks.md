Notes

Tasks are intentionally granular to make progress trackable and to allow concurrent work across different domains (marketing, engineering, legal).

Adjust the timing and owner as the project evolves; this document should be updated regularly in concert with the roadmap.

Some tasks may transition from the personal list to an agent’s responsibility as the product matures (e.g., Finance Agent handling invoicing).

Use this checklist to ensure that non‑technical work does not fall behind the product build.
